### Practice Field: Expanse is a sandbox practice game mode for the Overwatch Workshop.
One player is put in a bubble against one enemy dummy bot. The player can use any hero they would like to practice on. The spawn ranges and play area will be automatically adapted to the optimal sizes for the hero they chose.

### Development History
I started this project in January 2020 as soon as the "Workshop Expanse" map was released on the PTR. The idea came from my first practice mode on the Practice Range that spawned random types of enemies and gave them *very* rudimentary movement. I knew I wanted something that would spawn enemies at random distances from me facing a random direction. Initially I only intended it to be a small Widowmaker warmup and flick practice mode. It is currently in the pre-release stage with changes happening rapidly. I anticipate to release version 1.0.0 by January 1, 2020 at the latest.
