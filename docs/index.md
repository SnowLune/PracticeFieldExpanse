### ***Practice Field: Expanse*** *is a sandbox practice game mode for the Overwatch Workshop.*
Up to six players are spread across the map "Workshop Expanse". Each player is put in a bubble against an enemy dummy bot. The player kills the enemy bot and progresses to the next hero in the list when the "Kill Goal" is met. The player can select any hero they would like to practice on. The enemy spawn distances and play area will automatically be adapted to the optimal sizes for the chosen hero.
### AI Bots 
The bots have AI scripting for every hero that I have programmed from scratch.
### Scaling Difficulties
The are currently 11 difficulties ranging from "No AI Easy" ('No AI' meaning they do not have AI or attack, but simply move.) to "AI Bronze" to "AI Top 500".
The difficulties named for competitive tiers approximately reflect the aim, movement, and reaction time of real players at those tiers.
### In-Game Menu
The custom in-game menu can be accessed at any time with a quick key combination.
The menu allows the player to:
* Set difficulty to the desired level
* Enable or Disable various modes that affect play
* Set the language
* and more...
### Sandbox Approach to Practice
**Practice Field: Expanse** is designed so that players can configure their own settings to best aid what they would like to practice.

A few examples: 
* The player wishes to get better at ***Roadhog***'s *Chain Hook* combo against supports.
  * Open the in-game menu, set the "1 Second Cooldown" mode to "Player" so that the player's cooldowns are automatically refreshed
  * While still in the menu, set the "Hero Class" to "Support"
  * Close the menu and hook to your heart's content
* The player would just like to practice a ***Widowmaker*** 1v1 as long as they are in queue.
  * Select ***Widowmaker***
  * Using the key combination described in the top left to select a specific enemy hero, select ***Widowmaker***
  * Open the in-game menu, set the difficulty to the desired difficulty and set the "Kill Goal" to "Infinite"
  * Close the menu and begin the 1v1

### Development History
I started this project in January 2020 as soon as the "Workshop Expanse" map was released on the PTR. The idea came from my first practice mode on the Practice Range that spawned random types of enemies and gave them *very* rudimentary movement. I knew I wanted something that would spawn enemies at random distances from me facing a random direction. Initially I only intended it to be a small Widowmaker warmup and flick practice mode. It is currently in the pre-release stage with changes happening rapidly. **I anticipate to release version 1.0.0 by January 1, 2020 at the latest.**
